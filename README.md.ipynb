    "# Optimizing Customer Retention Spend Using AI-Driven Churn Risk Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Customer churn is one of the biggest silent revenue losses for e-commerce businesses.  \n",
    "While many systems predict *who* might churn, they fail to answer the more critical business question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which customers should we act on, and how, given limited retention budgets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds an **end-to-end Databricks Lakehouse solution** that not only predicts customer churn but also **translates predictions into prioritized, cost-aware retention actions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is designed to be **production-ready, automated, governed, and explainable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "E-commerce platforms often:\n",
    "- Lose customers without early warning\n",
    "- Spend heavily on blanket discounts and campaigns\n",
    "- Lack clarity on which customers are worth saving\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Build an AI system that:\n",
    "- Identifies churn-prone customers\n",
    "- Estimates revenue at risk\n",
    "- Recommends targeted retention actions\n",
    "- Helps businesses optimize retention spend\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why AI (Not Rule-Based Systems)\n",
    "Rule-based churn detection fails because:\n",
    "- Customer behavior is non-linear\n",
    "- Purchase patterns vary across customers\n",
    "- Fixed thresholds cannot adapt to changing trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning learns behavioral patterns from historical data and supports **data-driven decision-making** instead of static rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Architecture\n",
    "The project follows the **Databricks Lakehouse Medallion Architecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥉 Bronze Layer\n",
    "- Raw transactional data ingestion\n",
    "- Immutable, auditable Delta tables\n",
    "- Ingestion metadata for lineage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥈 Silver Layer\n",
    "- Cleaned and validated transactions\n",
    "- Customer-level feature engineering\n",
    "- Business-driven churn labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥇 Gold Layer\n",
    "- Business-ready churn insights\n",
    "- Risk segmentation\n",
    "- Actionable retention recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 ML Layer\n",
    "- Churn prediction model\n",
    "- MLflow experiment tracking\n",
    "- Predictions stored back to Delta tables\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "Customer behavior is captured using:\n",
    "- **Recency** – Days since last purchase\n",
    "- **Frequency** – Number of purchases\n",
    "- **Monetary Value** – Total spend\n",
    "- **Average Order Value** – Spending behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Churn Definition\n",
    "A customer is labeled as churned if they have not made a purchase in the last **90 days**  \n",
    "(This is a business assumption and can be tuned.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "- **Problem Type**: Binary Classification\n",
    "- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression\n",
    "- **Reasoning**:\n",
    "  - Interpretable\n",
    "  - Efficient baseline model\n",
    "  - Suitable for business explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "- Train/Test split (80/20)\n",
    "- ROC-AUC used as primary metric\n",
    "- MLflow used for:\n",
    "  - Parameter tracking\n",
    "  - Metric logging\n",
    "  - Model versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Prediction to Business Decisions (Key Differentiator)\n",
    "Instead of stopping at churn prediction, the system:\n",
    "- Segments customers into **Low / Medium / High Risk**\n",
    "- Estimates **revenue at risk**\n",
    "- Recommends **targeted retention actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Actions\n",
    "- **High Risk + High Value** → Discount incentive\n",
    "- **Medium Risk** → Re-engagement email\n",
    "- **Low Risk** → Loyalty rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures retention efforts are **focused, cost-aware, and impactful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytics & Insights\n",
    "SQL-based analytics answer key business questions:\n",
    "- How many customers are at high churn risk?\n",
    "- How much revenue is at risk?\n",
    "- Who should be prioritized for retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights can directly support marketing and business teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orchestration\n",
    "- End-to-end pipeline automated using **Databricks Jobs**\n",
    "- Tasks executed in sequence:\n",
    "  - Bronze → Silver → Gold → ML Training\n",
    "- Pipeline is retrainable and production-ready\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Governance\n",
    "- **Unity Catalog** used for data organization\n",
    "- Logical separation of:\n",
    "  - Raw data\n",
    "  - Processed data\n",
    "  - Business insights\n",
    "  - ML artifacts\n",
    "- Designed with access control and data lineage in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations & Future Enhancements\n",
    "- Churn threshold is a business assumption\n",
    "- Cost-sensitive modeling can further optimize decisions\n",
    "- A/B testing can validate retention strategies\n",
    "- Real-time inference can be added\n",
    "- Additional features (customer tenure, category diversity) can improve accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "- Modular notebooks\n",
    "- Delta Lake storage\n",
    "- Automated orchestration\n",
    "- Clear data flow and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates how AI can move beyond prediction and support **real business decisions**.  \n",
    "By combining Databricks Lakehouse architecture with machine learning and analytics, the system helps businesses **retain the right customers at the right cost**.\n"
